<B>How this benefits everyone:</B>
<br>
### For you:
  - Use this as a changelog! See what's changed in the awesome sauce parts of the site.
  - Create a "new issue" in the Issues tab to bring something up regarding the site. (or message Tenko xd)
  - If the site is ever down, you can always look here for clues.
### For me (and you):
- As Tenko learns more about what they can do with Git, this should hopefully speed up, simplify, and futureproof how the project is maintained as it continues to change and grow.
