To describe what this is in a nutshell: It's the silliness of Neocities, about Tenko's Neopets, with character profiles like Toyhou.se<br>

However, in 2020 Tenko decided to make his own site for the following reasons:
- Neocities is great for most people, but you can hit the limit of what it can do versus what you want it to do. Tenko hit it. 
- Neopets is still technically a kids site, and Tenko doesn't want to risk tripping the kiddie filter
- Toyhou.se is not suitable for what Tenko needs, and Tenko doesn't really like using it either
- A memorable (and relatable) URL to view Tenko's Neopets immediately on any computer
### BENEFITS FOR YOU:
  - There are two branches, develop and master, and also releases:
    - The develop branch is the latest stuff being worked on, may or may not be live on the site
    - The master branch ideally should be a copy of what the site looks like right now
      - Not every master branch is a release, read below
    - Releases are milestones! A update worthy of patch notes you should look at!
      - Generally these are huge updates to a character page or more, the collage, etc.
  - If the site is ever down, you can always look here for clues.
### BENEFITS FOR ME (AND YOU):
- As Tenko learns more about what they can do with Git, this should hopefully speed up, simplify, and futureproof how the project is maintained as it continues to change and grow.
