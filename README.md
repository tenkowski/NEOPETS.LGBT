<b>NEOPETS.LGBT</b> is Tenkowski's blend of the silliness of Neocities with the character profile sharing aspect of Toyhou.se.<br>
Even though it's static pages, putting the project on here helps Tenkowski keep track of how the pages changes over time! <br>
<h3> NEOPETS.LGBT on GitHub is helpful for you too.</h3>
Making changelogs HAH. Bori Bori! Just look at all the code changing around here! <br>
Come back here if you think something is wrong with the site or wanna peep the code!
